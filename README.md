This repository is the official implementation of "A framework for Benchmarking Class-out-of-distribution Detection and its Application to ImageNet", accepted to ICLR 2023 as a notable-top-25%, by Ido Galil, Mohammed Dabbah and Ran El-Yaniv:

## Usage
An in-depth guide with examples for how to use the framework is provided in example.ipynb, it is **very recommended** to start there.

This framework allows to benchmark C-OOD detection performance on any custom dataset (including ImageNet, as described in the paper) of models and their confidence function (OOD detection algorithm, i.e, ODIN, softmax, MC Dropout, etc.).

## Instructions for Downloading and Extracting the Dataset
To download the dataset, please access the file parts at the following link:
https://technionmail-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mdabbah_technion_ac_il/Enq4_ikDQzVIlsMlc3toIvsBMfukjl_ocs2AKsDirAa00A?e=eAXV8F

Concatenate the dataset zip parts into a single tar file and extract it to a directory of your choice using the following commands:

```
cat dataset.parta* > dataset.tar                     ## This command concatenates the dataset parts together.
tar -xzvf dataset.tar.gz -C </path/to/directory/>    ## This command extracts the dataset to a given directory.
unzip missing_files.zip -d </path/to/directory>      ## This command adds 46 missing files from our original tar file.
```

After executing these commands, you will find a directory called "imagenet_11k" in the location specified by `</path/to/directory/>`.

After downloading and extracting the dataset, use our method get_paper_ood_dataset_info to build a dataset metadata object that's used for dataset loading in our implementation (see example.ipynb for usage examples). 
Make sure to pass the path to the dataset as </path/to/directory>/imagenet_11k. 
You can use the skip_scan parameter to check for missing files in your copy by setting it to 'False'.

We recommend developing and testing in a Linux environment, as we are aware that Windows Defender might delete some images (the ones from 'missing_files.zip'), thinking they are a threat.

For the ID dataset, we used the ImageNet 1K validation set. Please download it from the official ImageNet website after creating an account and logging in at:
https://image-net.org/data/ILSVRC/2012/ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar

After downloading the `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar` file, decompress it to a directory of your choice using the following command:

```
tar -xzvf ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar -C </path/to/destination_id/> 
```

After decompression, you will find a directory called "ILSVRC2012_img_val" in your directory.

To use our method `get_paper_id_dataset_info`, pass the path `</path/to/destination_id/>/ILSVRC2012_img_val`. In that method, you can also use the `skip_scan` flag to check for missing files in your copy of ImageNet's validation set.

Please contact us if you find images missing.


## Upcoming features
We plan to add a few more features in the following updates, including:

1. Including \ excluding “biologically distinct” classes (viceroy butterflies vs. monarch butterflies etc.) and “visually ambiguous objects” (ping pong balls vs. cue balls etc.). More information about this is provided in Section 4 of the paper.
